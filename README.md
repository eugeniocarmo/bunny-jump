<h1>Phaser 3 Game Development with Modern JavaScript - bunny-jump game </h1>

This is a project from Ourcade.co that uses Phaser 3 and modern JavaScript to create a game. If you're interested in game development with Phaser, this project will teach you how to preload assets, create sprites, extend Phaser types, use Arcade Physics, reuse GameObjects with Groups, use the Camera to follow the player, change Scenes, use Text for UI, listen for Keyboard input, play sound effects, and more!

<h2>Setup</h2>
There is no complex setup required for this project. All you need is Visual Studio Code and Chrome.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
To use this project, clone or download the repository, and open it in Visual Studio Code. The code is split into separate files and organized using modern JavaScript best practices. We use the import/export module syntax for dependencies, including Phaser.

<h2>Code Completion and IntelliSense</h2>
We'll show you how to get Phaser 3 code completion and IntelliSense without using TypeScript or installing packages from NPM. We're committed to using modern JavaScript best practices in this project and will show you how to avoid littering your game code with references to the global scope.
